# vSongBook Privacy Policy
Respect for your privacy is coded into our DNA. Since we started vSongBook, we’ve aspired to build our Services with a set of strong privacy principles in mind.

vSongBook provides offline access to song lyrics used in our various praise and worship services from churches, weddings, funerals and even in other setups like at home and in office. Basically our core value to enable you to sing from anywhere you wish to sing from without necessarily having to have a physical songbook.
