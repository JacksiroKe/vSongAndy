## History

vSongBook was first developed in September 2014 as [android application](https://appsmata.com/vsongbook) by [Brother Jack Siro](https://github.com/jacksiroke) then an ICT student at [KTTC](https://kttc.ac.ke). Having learnt basics of android app development from one of his friends, Georffrey Omenda, he felt he could try to digitize the Songs of Worship and Nyimbo za Injili into an app for himself just like the Bible was an app on his phone.

While at home in December the same year his father who came to his room to check on him and ask 'some little computer questions' noticed an unfamiliar app on his phone. On learning and interacting with it he asked to have it on his phone. Brother Siro, the happy father went ahead to share the app Jack's elder brothers. Later while at the End of Year Meetings at Mbale, Kenya he endosed it there during one of his sermons. The app by then had only 100 Songs of Worship as well as 100 Nyimbo za Injili songs.

Due to pressure to have all the songs in the app he invited Brother George Gitau then BBIT student at JKUAT to type the songs for him. By the mid of 2015 all the songs in the tow major songbooks were in digital format. However because of insufficient funds he could not afford to host the app on playstore. But God who was ever on his side connected him with Kevin Ngalonde, a brother from Zimbabwe who owned ZimApps a small startup. Brother Kevin generously hosted the app for him until when he would be able to have his own Playstore account. During that same time he met Pastor Waheire of Banana Believers Church who sponsored the digitizing of Nyimbo cia Kuinira Ngai, the Kikuyu songbook.

In August 2015 while at attachment he made a new update made users of the app pay Ksh 200 to use the app without which the app would cease to work five days after installation. Mode of payment was though mobile money to his personal mobile money account. He would then send a short code to the user to activate the app. This then became a major income earner for him while still a student and he was able to expand his territory to Windows Phone in 2016. In mid 2016 when he managed to have his own Playstore account that he now hosts the app from.
