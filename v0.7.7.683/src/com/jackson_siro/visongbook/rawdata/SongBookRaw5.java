Be in time ... $ While the voice of Jesus calls you, $ Be in time . . . $ If in sin you longer wait $ You may find no open gate, $ And your cry be just too late, $ Be in time. $ $ Fairest flowers soon decay, $ Youth and beauty pass away, $ Oh, you have not long to stay, $ Be in time. $ While God^s Spirit bids you come, $ Sinner, do not longer roam, $ Lest you seal your hopeless doom, $ Be in time. $ $ Time is swiftly gliding by, $ Death and judgment draweth nigh. $ To the arms of Jesus fly, $ Be in time. $ Oh, I pray you count the cost, $ Ere the fatal line be crossed, $ And your soul in hell be lost, $ Be in time. $ $ Sinner, heed the warning voice, $ Make the Lord your choice, $ Then all heaven will rejoice, $ Be in time. $ Come, from darkness into light, $ Come, let Jesus make you right, $ Come, and start for heaven tonight, $ Be in time. $ $ #RedemptionSongs",
    			"NOUGHT HAVE I gotten but what I received; $ Grace hath bestowed it since I have believed, $ Boasting excluded, pride I abase: $ I^m only a sinner saved by grace! $ Only a sinner saved by grace! $ Only a sinner saved by grace! $ This is my story, to God be the glory, $ I^m only a sinner saved by grace! $ $ Once I was foolish and sin ruled my heart, $ Causing my footsteps from God to depart, $ Jesus hath found me, happy my case  $ I now am a sinner saved grace! $ $ Tears unavailing, no merit had I; $ Mercy had saved me, or else I must die; $ Sin had alarmed me, fearing God^s face; $ But now I^m a sinner saved by grace! $ $ Suffer a sinner whose heart overflows, $ Loving his Saviour, to tell what he knows; $ Once more to tell it, would I embrace  $ I^m only a sinner saved by grace. $ $ #RedemptionSongs",
    			"O SINNER, the Saviour is calling for thee, $ Long, long has He called thee in vain; $ He called thee when joy lent its crown to thy days, $ He called thee in sorrow and pain. $ Oh, turn while the Saviour in mercy is waiting. $ And steer for the harbour light; $ For how do you know but your soul may be drifting $ Over the deadline tonight? $ $ O sinner, thine ears have been deaf to His voice, $ Thine eyes to His glory been dim; $ The calls of thy Saviour have so wearied thee, $ Oh, what if they should weary Him? $ $ O sinner, the Spirit is striving with thee; $ What if He should strive never more? $ But leave thee alone in thy darkness to dwell, $ In sight of the heavenly shore? $ $ O sinner, God^s patience my weary some day, $ And leave thy sad soul in the blast; $ By wilful resistance you^ve drifted away, $ Over the deadline at last. $ $ #RedemptionSongs",
